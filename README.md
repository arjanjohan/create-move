## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.17)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold Move, follow the steps below:

1. Install from NPM Registry and follow the CLI instructions.

```
npx create-move@latest
```
2. Initialize an Aptos account

```
yarn account
```

This command creates a new account and funds it from the faucet. The default network is Aptos testnet, to use other networks use the --network tag.

3. Deploy the test contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

4. On a second terminal, start your NextJS app:

```
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your Move modules using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
